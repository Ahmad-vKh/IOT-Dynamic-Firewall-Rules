# üî• Adaptive Firewall Profile Selection for IoT Systems

A senior design project for Princess Sumaya University for Technology that implements a **centralized, adaptive firewall management system** for securing IoT networks using lightweight edge devices such as Raspberry Pi.

## üìå Overview

IoT environments are highly heterogeneous, comprising devices with limited CPU, memory, and power. Traditional static firewalls are insufficient. This project introduces a **resource-aware firewall selection scheme** that:

- Monitors real-time metrics (CPU, RAM, traffic)
- Dynamically assigns one of four firewall profiles (Idle, Low, High, Critical)
- Uses `nftables` and `ASCON-128a` encryption for secure, efficient management
- Operates through a centralized controller (RP5)

## üß† System Design

The system is composed of:

- **1 Central Node (RP5)** ‚Äì Coordinates, analyzes, and assigns profiles
- **3+ Edge Nodes (RP4s)** ‚Äì Simulate IoT devices under variable workloads
- **Smart Plugs (Tapo P110)** ‚Äì Measure power usage for energy efficiency validation

üìä Metrics collected:
- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- Simulated traffic

üîê Security:
- ASCON-128a (lightweight encryption)
- HKDF key derivation
- JSON over TCP sockets
- Pre-shared symmetric key for session encryption

|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Idle           | Device underutilized (low load)       | Deny-all traffic, minimal exposure                                       |
| Low Activity   | Light workloads, e.g., wearable data  | Stateless filtering, whitelisted IPs                                     |
| High Activity  | Intensive workload, e.g., ventilator  | Stateful inspection, connection tracking, rate limiting                  |
| Critical Task  | Sensitive operations, e.g., imaging   | DPI via Suricata, high-security rules, IDS/IPS                           |
